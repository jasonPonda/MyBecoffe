## The Mission

- People related to the BeCoffe Academy are listed in a database. Relevant informations to save are: first name, last name, email (for logging in), password, account_type (chef or learner). You can add more fields if you want (twitter account, profile picture, ... it's up to you!)
- Learners can pick a daily slot for "The Recette", you must ensure that for any given date there is one (no less, no more) talk by a learner. For each of them you must at least store the topic of the recipe, the date it will be (or was) presented, and the learner who presented it.
- Learners must be present every week day. To verify that this was indeed the case you should design a mechanism so that when a learner presses a button it stores the arrival & when they press the button back at the end of the day it store the departure time. Make a table to store all learners arrival and departure time. Chefs do not need to check in/out of class, they are Chefs after all...
- People that are not logged in cannot see any information
- Learners can see all previous and future "The recette" listed on a page, and their own attendance informations.
- Chefs can see past and future "The Recette" and everyones attendances information.
